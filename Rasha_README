natural_partitions :

	1. generated by ./nfatool -i ../anmlzoobenchmarks -m max_partition_size 
	2. The command generates natural partitions as anml files as well as related dot files. This is used to compare 
	   between our partitions and vasim's 


mapping :

	1. go to /share/karakchi/Desktop/nfatool/mapping_folder/
	2. g++ mapping.cpp -I/usr/include/libxml2 -fopenmp -g -DDEBUG -lxml2 -lpcre  -o mapping
	3. for i in {0..num_partitions-1}; do ./mapping -i /share/karakchi/Desktop/nfatool/automata_$i.anml -f #max_fanout; done 


	Hint: Snort, and ER needs to optimize boolean elements 



do files: 

	1. two c files are added to nfatool 
		do_next.c to configure the next_state_tables 
		do_gates.c to configure the gates 

	2. Do files are generated by running ./nfatool -i /anmlfile/ -m #max_hardware_stes -x max_hardware_fanout 
		options -m and -x are used to customize the hardware
